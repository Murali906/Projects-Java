# Material-Gatepass---Web-Portal
This project is based on the design and implementation of the material gate pass system.

A gate pass as the name suggests is the activity of the security personnel and is the 
focal point of an organizationâ€™s security set up. 

This is an online implementation of the aforementioned material gate pass system where we 
create a web portal. Documentation of all records of the gate  passes is made easier with
the use of database management systems, approval of any material can be relayed through 
email notifications, alerts as a reminder to the concerned person for the return of an 
item is also made easier. This enables an increase in the efficiency and productivity 
of the working of the organization on the whole.

Functionalities of the portal :
-->Register user
-->Create new requests
-->See Notifications
-->Manage approvals 

The webportal is wriiten using JSPs, Java servlets and Apache Tomcat similar to a LAMP environment.
